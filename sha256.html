            <p>The internet stores passwords as hashes resultant from algorithms such as
              the Secure Hash Algorithm (256 bits). To understand the algorithm more, I recreated it in python. The SHA-256
              algorithm takes in a string (ie a password) and outputs a seemingly random 256 bit string of numbers and letters. 
              There are a couple of factors that make for a good hashing algorithm.
              <ul>
                <li>Same output for same input</li>
                <li>Small changes in the input results in large changes in the output</li>
                <li>One-way, cannot derive input from output</li>
              </ul>
              Instead of a server (website such as Facebook) storing passwords as plain text, they are
              stored as their hashes. This means if the server is hacked, the hacker only has the hashes, not
              the passwords. Since hashes are one-way, the hacker cannot get the password.

              <a href="https://helix.stormhub.org/papers/SHA-256.pdf">This pdf</a> was used as a guide for
              a high level explanation of the algorithm. It was hard to find the author of the pdf, but following
              the watermark in the corner "CRIPTOGRAFIA", google leds me to believe it is a document by Prof.
              Fernando Martinez Saez from FIB (technical school in Barcelona).<br>
              <a href="https://youtu.be/orIgy2MjqrA?si=4hF9WfaLAhn4Wl-F">This video</a> by RedBlockBlue was used as well to verify
              some of the intermediate values in the algorithm. It was tricky to debug this program because the point
              of the algorithm is to not be able to get information about the output from the input. RedBlockBlue basically
              explained a similar pdf as the one from FIB but no source was provided. I did leave a comment asking for the source
              of the pdf used in the video.

            <div class="bSub"><p><b>SHA-256 Overview</b></p></div>
            <p>The SHA-256 algorithm class takes in input text. Generally this can be any data, but for our case, it will be a string of text. The
              text is then converted into binary. The class requires an ASCII input (normal english characters, numbers, and symbols). Each
              character in the input is converted to its binary representation. For example <code>'abc'</code> is converted to <code>'01100001 01100010 01100011'</code>.
              <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/sha256/img1.jpg" alt="str to bin code"></img>
              Each character in the string <code>A</code> is converted first to its ASCII number and then to binary. The <code>bin()</code> adds a flag <code>'0b0</code> to the front
              of the number so it is removed with <code>[2:]</code>. Finally the binary number is padded with zeros so that it is exactly 8 bits long. After
              this is done for all  characters in the string, the combined binary number is returned. In the case of <code>'abc'</code>,
              <code>'011000010110001001100011'</code> is returned.
              <p />
              This message then needs to be padded so that it is a multiple of 512 bits. The algorithm requires the message to be
              padded with a <code>'1'</code> and then enough <code>'0'</code>s so the length is <code>448 % 512</code> (64 minus a multiple of 512). Finally the length of
              the original message is converted to binary, padded so it is length 64, and appended to the message. This results in a
              message that is exactly 512 or 1024 or 1536, .. bits long.
              <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/sha256/img2.jpg" alt="pad msg so it is multiple of 512"></img>
              The first step in this method is to calculate how many <code>'0'</code>s are to be padded.
              <ul>
                <li><code>len(msg) = 440</code>: 7 <code>'0'</code>s are to be added (recall we always pad a <code>'1</code> to the message)</li>
                <li><code>len(msg) = 800</code>: 159 <code>'0'</code>s are to be added</li>
                <li><code>len(msg) = 449</code>: -2 <code>'0'</code>s are to be added (not possible)</li>
              </ul>
              The last case is not possible so we then need to pad the message to the next multiple of 512 (in this case, 1024). Instead
              of adding -2 <code>'0'</code>s we add 450 <code>'0'</code>s. We add the length of the message in binary and pad it so it is 64 bits long. For our string
              <code>'abc'</code>, the padded message is <code>'011000010110001001100011' + '0'*423 + '0'*62 + '11'</code>.
              <p />
              As an aside. I postulate that the algorithm requires us to add a <code>'1'</code> to handle specific cases. If the input string is blank
              and the <code>'1'</code> wasn't required, the padded message would just be a string of 512 <code>'0'</code>s. This would make the output predictable (not good).
              <p />
              Once we have the padded message, the hash can be computed.
              <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/sha256/img3a.jpg" alt="compute hash of msg"></img>
              <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/sha256/img3b.jpg" alt="compute hash of msg"></img>
              This method starts with 8 32 bit numbers <code>H</code>> and combines them in various ways with parts of the message many times.
              After the method finishes, the 8 <code>H</code>> numbers are concatenated and returned as the hash.
              <p />
              The method if initializes the variable <code>prev_H</code> with the 8 starting values of <code>H</code>>. It then entries a for loop that loops for
              each 512 bit block in the message. If the message is 512 bits, the loop only runs once. A message of length 1024 would loop
              twice, and so on. The loop first takes the corresponding section of the message and stores it as <code>Mi</code> and breaks the section
              of the message into 64 words (words are 64 bits long). The variables <code>a</code> through <code>h</code> are initialized to the values of <code>H</code>.
              For each word in <code>Mi</code>, an inner loop is run. This inner loop calculates two values <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> using the variables <code>a</code> through <code>h</code>,
              a "random" value <code>K</code>, and the word. These two values and then used to change the values of <code>a</code> through <code>h</code>. The <code>H</code> values are then
              combined with <code>a</code> through <code>h</code> and the inner for loop continues. Once both for loops have completed, the <code>H</code> values are concatenated
              and returned. For the input <code>'abc'</code>, the result of this is <code>'1011101001111000000101101011111110001111000000011100111111101010010000010100000101000000110111100101110110101110001000100010001110110000000000110110000110100011100101100001011101111010100111001011010000010000111111110110000111110010000000000001010110101101'</code>
              or <code>'ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad'</code> in hex (more common).

            <p>
              <code>H</code> and <code>K</code> are both lists of 'random' numbers used in the above hash function. They are actually derived from the square root
              and cube root, respectively. The reason for this is so that the numbers in the lists are as random as possible. <code>H</code> is used as
              the starting value for the hash. If the two above for loops were skipped (impossible), the resultant hash would be all initial
              8 <code>H</code> values concatenated. <code>K</code> is used in the inner loop (64 <code>K</code> values for 64 loops).
              <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/sha256/img4.jpg" alt="compute H value"></img>
              For a given <code>i</code>, the <code>H[i] </code>is found from getting the ith prime number and taking the square root, taking only the fractional
              part and converting it to binary. <code>K</code> is the same but using the cube root.
              <p />
              A quick aside into primes. When creating this class I could have just hard-coded the prime numbers into the script, but
              instead I wrote a function to calculate the list every time the class is run.
              <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/sha256/img5.jpg" alt="calculate list of i prime numbers"></img>
              A prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 and is only divisible by itself and 1. A neat trick about numbers is
              that if you cannot divide by its factors, you cannot divide by multiples of its factors. For example 15 is not divisible by
              2, therefore 15 is not divisible by 4 and 8. To create a list of <code>i</code> prime numbers, we start at 2 and check if it is divisible by
              any of the previously defined prime numbers. Since there are no prime numbers in our list yet, we add 2 to the list. This continues for
              3. When we get to 4, it is divisible by 2 so we do not add it to the list. This continues until we have <code>i</code> prime numbers.
            </p>
            <div class="bSub"><p><b>Diving Deeper: Breaking the message into words</b></p></div>
            <p>
              Recall that before we can break the message section <code>Mi</code> into words <code>W</code>, we first need to take the nth 512 bit chuck of the
              message <code>M</code>. Now <code>Mi</code> of length 512 bits needs to be split into 64 words each 32 bits long.
              <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/sha256/img6.jpg" alt="get words from message"></img>
              The first 16 words are the message split into the appropriate chucks, the next 48 words are more complex. They follow a
              equation that requires the previous words to be calculated. It is the summation (and truncation to 32 bits) of <code>s1</code>> of <code>W[i-2]</code>,
              <code>s0</code> of <code>w[i-15]</code>, <code>w[i-7]</code>, and <code>w[i-16]</code>.
            </p>
            <div class="bSub"><p><b>Diving Deeper: s0, s1, S0, S1, ch, and maj</b></p></div>
            <p>
              The sigma functions <code>s0</code>, <code>s1</code>, <code>S0</code>, and <code>S1</code> are used in the main hash function and operate on a single, 32 bit input. The functions use
              <code>rot_r</code> and <code>sh_r</code> functions. The <code>rot_r</code> rotates <code>x</code> bits to the right. For example <code>'00001111'</code> rotated 3 bits will result in
              <code>'11100001'</code>. The <code>sh_r</code> shifts <code>x</code> bits to the right and then pads the left hand side with <code>'0'</code>s. For the same example, a shift
              of 3 will result in <code>'00000001'</code>. Each sigma uses a combination of these functions and then <code>XOR</code>'s the resulting values.

              <p />
              A quick aside into bitwise operators. Bitwise operators take into two values and outputs a third value. They act on each
              bit in the number. The <code>AND</code> operator results in a <code>'1'</code> if both bits are <code>'1'</code>  and <code>'0'</code> otherwise. The <code>OR</code> operator results in a
              <code>'0'</code> if both bits are <code>'0'</code> and <code>'1'</code>  otherwise. The <code>XOR</code> operator results in a <code>'0'</code> if both bits are the same and <code>'1'</code>  otherwise.
              The <code>COMP</code> operator acts only on one input and simply flips the bits.
              <p />
              The majority and choose function operate on three inputs of 32 bits and results in a single 32 bit output. The majority
              function returns which bit is in the majority. For example if <code>A, B, C</code> are  <code>'101'</code>, <code>'111'</code>, and <code>'001'</code>, the result is <code>'101'</code>.
              The choose function chooses between <code>B</code> or <code>C</code> depending on <code>A</code>'s bit. If <code>A</code> is <code>'1'</code> , the bit in <code>B</code> is chosen. If <code>A</code> is <code>'0'</code>, the bit in
              <code>C</code> is chosen. For example if <code>A, B, C</code> are  <code>'101'</code>>, <code>'110'</code>, and <code>'001'</code>, the result is <code>'100'</code>.
