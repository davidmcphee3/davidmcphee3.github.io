<div class="bTitle"><p><u><strong>F1 2022 Cars</strong></u><p /></div>
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/f12022cars/thumbnail.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for f1 2022 cars"></img>
2022 is the first season that I am fully involved in with F1. An exciting part of the season is when the teams
show off their car for the first time. Included is photos (with source) and some comments.
<p />All images from <a href="https://www.formula1.com">formula1.com</a>.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Mercedes</b><p /></div>
Constructors champions last year Mercedes will defend that title with the new regulations. The Mercees, along
with most other teams are 'porpoising' this year. In videos the violent bouncing is clear and is terriable for
the car. This is because at high speeds the downforce is great enough that the bottom of the car experiences
ground effect. Basically the ground compromises the aerodynamics.
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/f12022cars/img1.jpg" alt="Mercedes car"></img>
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Red Bull Racing</b><p /></div>
Driver champions last year with some super undercut side pods. These cut side pods look to be a very recent
addition because they are not even painted yet.
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/f12022cars/img2.jpg" alt="Red Bull car"></img>
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Ferrari</b><p /></div>
Meme king Ferrari, maybe this year is the year... They were top in the first practice and had ground effect
problems to a much lesser extent than Merc.
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/f12022cars/img3.jpg" alt="Ferrari car"></img>
<div class="bSub"><p><b>McLaren</b><p /></div>
McLaren has been battling for best of the rest over the past couple of years but are looking to maybe shake up
the top 3 this year around. They seem to be in a similar boat as Ferrari.
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/f12022cars/img4.jpg" alt="McLaren car"></img>
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Aston Martin</b><p /></div>
Aston Martin really has had a glo-up since the Racing Point Days. Seb was the first driver to say that he would
not race in Russia this year.

<div class="bSub"><p><b>Apline</b><p /></div>
My wife's favourite, because it is pink. Apline use to be a nice blue but BWT took over as a major major sponser
so I gues they get to add their own colours to it.
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/f12022cars/img6.jpg" alt="Apline car"></img>
<div class="bSub"><p><b>AlphaTauri</b><p /></div>
AlphaTauri is like Red Bull 2 but I really like Pierre Gasly so I am always cheering for them.
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/f12022cars/img7.jpg" alt="AlphaTauri car"></img>
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Alfa Romeo</b><p /></div>
I <3 the cameo livery. The livery is cameo because the Alfa car wasn't actually launched yet.
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/f12022cars/img8.jpg" alt="Alfa Romeo car"></img>
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Williams</b><p /></div>
Battle for not last. Oh how Williams use to be so good.
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/f12022cars/img9.jpg" alt="Williams car"></img>
<div class="bSub"><p><b>HAAS</b><p /></div>
HAAS is looking like the back-marker again even though they basically skipped 2021 to develop this car. Fun fact
this photo was taken right before Russia declared war on the Ukraine. HAAS is an american team but has a lot of
connections to Russian sponsers. The biggest HAAS sponser is Uralkali which is owned by Mazepin's father. This
is bad news for Mazepin who has been a 'pay driver' for a year now.
