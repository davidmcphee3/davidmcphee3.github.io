<div class="bTitle"><p><u><strong>Anne's First Road Trip</strong></u><p /></div>
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/adventures/firstroadtrip/thumbnail.png" alt="Thumbnail for First Road Trip"></img>
Anne's first road trip was from her home in Saskatoon to her grandparents home in Calgary. The drive without her
would typically take six and a half hours but with her took nine and a half! The extra time was because Anne
needed to feed every couple of hours and stretch her legs.<p />
Here is an overview of the stops on the trip. The original plan was simply Rosetown, Oyen, and Drumheller but we
soon learned that we needed to add many more stops.

<div class="bSub"><p><b>Saskatoon</b><p /></div>
The main theme of this trip was Anne's feeding times. This is because we had to be stopped while she fed. We did as
much packing as we could the night before but with babies, you need a lot of things all the time so we couldn't
pack too much of her stuff the night before. I also made lunch, chickpea sandwiches, for us the night before. Come
morning I do the rest of the packing. Melle's pants were still wet from the washer so she told me to find another
way to pack them other than a suitcase.

<div class="bSub"><p><b>Zealandia</b><p /></div>
The first stop of the trip! It was very tense, the roads were covered in snow and Zealandia is a tiny town so
not much signage. We meant to make it to Rosetown but Anne woke up and needed to feed because it had been about
three hours. We tried to stop in Harris (similar size) but couldn't slow down in time.<p />
We realized that we need to stop much more frequently and so we changed our game plan. I took a walk while Anne
and Mom were doing the first first road trip feed. Zealandia has a population of 80. Well 83 when we were there.
I took some photos of their attractions:

<div class="bSub"><p><b>Rosetown</b><p /></div>
Ten minutes away was Rosetown! It was around 11:30am already so we stopped for lunch. The original plan for lunch
was the chickpea sandwiches that I made the night before, but I forgot them! We stopped at Tim Hortons for coffee
and sandwiches. Melle topped off Anne and we were on the road again full, caffeinated, and happy.

We started to get into the swing of things and soon enough Anne was sleeping like, well, a baby (she is so cute).

<div class="bSub"><p><b>Kindersley</b><p /></div>
Kindersley has quite a few stores on either side of the highway and lots of trucks drive through. Disaster struck
when we were driving past one of these trucks...

<img class="bImg" src="/includes/adventures/firstroadtrip/img16.jpg" alt="Anne with Toy"></img>
It was so loud my ears were ringing for a couple of hours. Eventually the crack creeped around the entire
windshield.<p />
We stopped at Seven Eleven for gas and for Anne to feed again. They started feeding while I fuled up and then I
drove to a parking lot which Melle was not pleased with. Note: don't drive, even very slowly, while the wife is
feeding the baby.

<div class="bSub"><p><b>Oyen</b><p /></div>
We are officially in Alberta! Everytime we pass that sweetgrass sign we play Alberta Bound and sing along. Oyen
is special to the McPhees because it is almost exactly half way from Calgary to Saskatoon. Whenever we would
transfer goods/siblings we would meet in Oyen. <p />
I got this photo while we were stopped and Melle was inside buying
smarties.

<div class="bSub"><p><b>Hanna</b><p /></div>
Hanna! This was a quick stop to buy some chips and let Anne feed. I bought flaming-hot cool-ranch chips. They were
actually quite hot, hotter than sweet chili heat chips. I don't know if Melle liked them very much, she preferred
her clif bar.<p />
I like these boards that small towns have. They have all the updates that the town puts out and local ads.
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/adventures/firstroadtrip/img12.png" alt="Hanna Board"></img>
I gave Melle and Anne a warning that we were about to embark on the longest stretch, 1hr 30min. Anne just fed so
it was looking like we were going to be able to do it!
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Drumheller</b><p /></div>
We made it! Anne dropped her teething toy on the ground though so she couldn't chomp on it anymore. She also had
her biggest feed of the entire trip which Melle was super happy with. For the past feeds Anne wouldn't eat too
well but this time she fed for half an hour! I thought the sun was going to set before we got a chance to take
these photos:

<div class="bSub"><p><b>Calgary</b><p /></div>
We made it to Calgary in one piece and I am so happy that we did the trip. Anne, mom, and dad were all happy and
tired. Abby and Big Tuna were making dinner when we got there and Anne got introduced to them. Later that night
Melle went looking for her pants... which I forgot to pack!<p />
A list of people Anne met in Calgary for the first time:<br>

- Great Aunt Nicole<br>

- Great Aunt Rena<br>
- Great Grandma Gloria<br>
- Great Uncle Tim<br>
- 1st Cousin once removed Daylan<br>
