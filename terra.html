<div class="bTitle"><p><u><strong>Terra, A Not Very Stablecoin</strong></u><p /></div>
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/terra/thumbnail.png" alt="Thumbnail for terra"></img>
Terra was promised to combine the best of fiat and crypto currencies that would disrupt
the financial sector forever. The Terra project aimed to combine the stability of fiat
currencies with the speed, security, and decentralization of cryptocurrency. Terra
definitely disrupted the crypto world, maybe for the better or worse.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Stable <s>coin</s> currencies</b><p /></div>
Putting aside "stablecoins" for a moment, we need to answer three questions: what
currency is? why is it stable? and what does fiat mean?
<p />
Currency is a tool used to facilitate trade and reduce all goods and services down to a
unit of value. This tool can be used to trade any good or service for any other good
or service. For example, if I wanted to buy eggs from a farmer, I could simply pay
the price of the eggs with currency and the farmer could then use that money I gave
him to buy anything else, say a hat. However, if we did not have currency, the farmer
would have to find someone looking to trade their hat for some eggs. This can get out
of hand and more absurd if we think about or jobs and how we trade time for money.
If currency didn't exist, we would have to trade our time only for things we wanted
from people who had those things and were looking for labour. There have been many
forms of currencies throughout time, from as far back as Ancient Rome. Up until around
2008, all currency has been physical. 2008 saw a major financial crisis that shocked the
United States and the world. This sparked the invention of Bitcoin, a highly valuable
and unstable coin. We will focus on the American Dollar, USD, and why it is so valuable
and stable.
<p />
The Dollar was originally made of precious metals such as gold or silver. This made the
currency stable because gold and silver have intrinsic value and thus the Dollar also had
that same intrinsic value. During some of the country's harder times, the government
issued banknotes that would accrue some interest and be bought back at a later time.<sup>[1]</sup>
This funded the government's short-term war spending but also served as one of the first
"bills", so-called reserve notes. These bills were later more widely produced and served as
a much more convenient way of carrying currency. The reserve notes could always be traded
with the government for the equivalent amount of gold. This meant that the reserve note had
intrinsic value because it was linked to gold and thus it was a stable currency. It is
important for a currency to be stable because if not, a seller would not sell if he thought the
money was going to lose value and the buyer would not buy if they thought the money was going
to increase in value.
<p />
Eventually the gold standard became burdensome to the Government because of macroeconomic factors.
When a country's GDP is increasing, typically their currency becomes more valuable. This makes
local goods more expensive and incentives investing in other countries not so well off. On the
reverse, local goods become cheaper and other countries begin investing in the slowing economy. However,
gold does not become more or less valuable which means that when the United Stats was struggling to
pay for it's wars, the goods remained high and it hurt the consumer. This made the Dollar overvalued and
so other countries traded the for the Dollar to trade for gold. Most major currencies at that time
were pegged to the USD based on an international agreement which the US had to honour. This started
depleting the gold reserves of the States and if the government didn't act quickly, they would lose much
more of their gold.<sup>[2]</sup> Mr. Watergate, Richard Nixon, was forced to remove the Dollar from
the gold standard which was a radical idea at the time. This meant that now the Dollar was simply worth
a Dollar, or "fiat". The world did not implode and now the Dollar is one of, if not the, most
valuable currencies in the world. As of writing the Dollar is equal to 1.01 Euro.
<p />
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Currency Pegging</b><p /></div>
Many currencies around the world are "pegged" to the American Dollar. This means that they have a
fixed exchange rate, regardless of how the two economies are doing. The government maintains
this rate by only exchanging at the pegged rate, say 3 RM to 1 USD. Buyers will not accept a private
exchange rate higher than 3 RM to 1 USD because that would mean their RM is worth less than what the
government would pay. On the other hand, sellers would not accept a rate lower than 3 RM to 1 USD because
they know that they can get more RM from the government for the same USD. The government can only
maintain this fixed rate if it can always honour the exchange. This means that the government is
forced to hold a large stockpile reserve of USD to always trade at the fixed rate.
<p />
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Stablecoins</b><p /></div>
We can see how currency pegging can be applied to cryptocurrencies as well. If a company creates a
token and pegs it 1 for 1 with the Dollar, the company will have to always honor that rate. This
means that the crypto company will have to have a reserve of USD. The main issue with this solution
is the dependence on USD. A coin backed by the USD forces a dependence on the fiat currency, which
is one of the main issues Bitcoin was set out to solve. This type of token, a USD backed stablecoin,
is simply a digital representation of a Dollar. It does have its upsides, such as an anonymous,
public ledger, but that is only half the solution.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>The Other Half of The Solution</b><p /></div>
Terra, a company that set out to create a pegged stablecoin without the need to rely on reserves of the
American Dollar. Terra created a token, UST, pegged to the Dollar. This means that anyone can buy and sell
UST for $1 from Terra. The unique part of UST is that it is not back by the Dollar, rather an
algorithm with another token, LUNA.
<p />
A major roadblock with cryptocurrencies is the limited adoption. No consumer wants to buy a coin
that they cannot spend, and no merchant wants to build the infrastructure to accept a coin no one has.
<p />
We will go through the Terra whitepaper, which lays out the solution to both of these problems, pegging
a coin without a large reserve, and adoption.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>UST and LUNA</b><p /></div>
Governments around the world use fiscal policy to increase and decrease the money supply
to maintain the GDP, inflation, etc. Bitcoin does not have this luxury because the Bitcoin miners
only ever create tokens, not destroy them. An elastic money supply is a contributing factor to
price stability and thus is desired by Terra. When the demand for the Terra stablecoin, UST,
increases, so does the total supply of UST. On the contrary, when the demand decreases, so too
does the supply of UST. What this means is there must be a method for both injecting and removing
UST from the market. To create this elastic monetary policy, Terra has a second token, LUNA. The
Terra protocol will always accept 1 UST for $1 worth of LUNA and visa versa. As with pegged
currencies, the protocol (or government) always offers a fixed rate. No other rate will be accepted
for the same reasons outlined previously. If UST is only worth $0.99, then consumers/arbitragers/users
can send their UST to the protocol, receive $1 worth of LUNA and then sell that LUNA to make a very easy
and risk-free profit of $0.01. This arbitrage will force the exchange rate of UST up until it reaches
the $1.00 mark. The same chain of events can happen in reverse if the exchange range is more than $1.00
<p />
Like other cryptocurrencies, Terr, has miners which use the Proof of Stake authentication method.
Simply put, the protocol randomly elects a miner to create a new block of transactions based on a
weighted lottery system. The weight is determined by how much LUNA the miner stakes. The winner is
rewarded with more LUNA and the transaction fees. If the miner acts in bad faith, validated by the
other miners, the bad actor will lose it's stake. The LUNA price will fluctuate in order to maintain
the UST peg which in turn fluctuates the actual value of the miner's stake. Since LUNA is a representation
of mining power, the mining power will fluctuate to maintain the peg.
<p />
As the demand for UST increases, the exchange rate will creep above the peg. When this happens,
instead of trading on the market, users can send $1 worth of LUNA to the system and receive 1 UST. The
system then burns a portion of the LUNA (destroys it) and sends the remaining portion to the
Treasury. This burning of LUNA makes it more valuable and thus increases the value of mining. On the
other hand, when demand for UST decreases, the supply of LUNA increases to buy the UST at the peg
rate which increases the supply of LUNA, decreasing its value and thus decreases the value of mining.
This shows how UST is able to offload its volatilely to LUNA, i.e. the miners.
<p />
So why would anyone want to become a miner for the Terra protocol if it was volatile? The solution
to this is to offer stable and predictable transaction fees to offset the short-term volatility
for miners. The profit for miners is based on the transaction fees they receive and the total LUNA
supply. Miner profits are proportional to miner rewards and inversely proportional to the LUNA supply.
Thus, to increase miner profits, the rewards can be increased, and the LUNA supply decreased. To lower
miner profits, the rewards can be decreased and the LUNA supply increased. This two-factor
relationship means that the miner rewards can stay stable in most economic conditions. The whitepaper
offers an equation to regulate the miner rewards by adjusting the transaction fees and teh LUNA
burn rate (the burn rate controls the supply of LUNA). Finally, this equation also includes a
growth factor which ensures that the miner’s investment will grow in the long term, even if there
is short-term volatility.
<p />
The equations are elegant and are included. <i>f<sub>t</sub></i> is the transaction fees, <i>R<sub>t</sub></i>
is the mining reward, <i>b<sub>t</sub></i> is the burn percentage, and <i>g</i> is a growth factor.
<img class="bEqu" height="60px" src="/includes/other/terra/img1.png" alt="Fee and burn rate equations"></img>
As rewards increase, fees and burn rate decrease which then decreases the rewards. As rewards decrease,
fees and burn rate increase which then increase the reward.
<p />
This plan shows how UST can maintain its peg by offloading its volatility onto LUNA, which
represents the miners. The miners are compensated by steady, growth driven rewards because they take
on this short-term volatility.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Adoption</b><p /></div>
Terra is only useful if people actually use it. No bank will offer mortgages paid in UST if their
consumers do not own any. No consumer will hold UST if it cannot be spent or invested. It makes
much more sense for a user to buy traditional investments rather than hold UST. Therefore, Terra offered
chequing accounts with 20% returns, which is 4x better than what someone might reasonably expect with
a TFSA.
<p />
dApps are protocols built on specific blockchains that serve a purpose. For example, a dApp can
be used as a will, investment account, gambling, etc. Terra incentives creators to work on their
blockchain by offering funding from the Terra Treasury. Terra laid out a plan and equation for miners to
chose which dApps get funded based on growth and revenue. The equation they presented can have
the weighting altered to change whether growth- or revenue-based dApps get funding. This
algorithmic funding is transparent and predictable as opposed to more traditional, open-ended funding.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Rise of Terra UST</b><p /></div>
"If Bitcoin's contribution to cryptocurrency was immutability, and Ethereum expressivity, our
value-add will be usability".<sup>[3]</sup> This quote from the whitepaper shows the main objective
of Terra. Their goal was to have a price-stable coin that could be used for all different types of
financial transactions. Terra gained traction in 2018 and became popular in East Asia, where it was
headquartered. This is because users where offered enticing investment offers and saw it as a
relatively safe investment because they could always liquidate their account for its equivalent
price in USD or any stablecoin for that matter. Once consumers started having sizable amounts of
this coin, Terr was able to convince payment apps to accept it.
<p />
During covid, the cryptoverse saw a boom in investment and with Terra being seen as a safe investment,
people flocked to it. This continued all the way through 2021 and the beginning of 2022. Around this
time world governments became weary of inflation and increased the interest rates. This increase caused
more risky assets to be dumped in favor of traditionally safe investments, like bank stocks or EFTs.
Terra prepared for the oncoming crypto winter by buying Bitcoin for a reserve fund to maintain the
peg of UST.
<p />
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Fall of Terra</b><p /></div>
On a historic day in May 2022, the peg of UST wobbled. This wobble was caused by a couple of
large sell offs of UST by a few accounts. This sell-off increased the supply of LUNA by a
sizeable amount. This was the purpose of LUNA, to offset UST volatility. However, the UST
exchange rate dropped low enough that some major holders got worried and exchanged their UST for
more LUNA. Once the UST began trading well below its peg, holders rapidly sold their UST and LUNA
to cut their losses. After a day or two UST completely lost its peg, and LUNA went through
hyper-inflation.
<p />
Terra suffered from a death spiral which some even predicted when the project was first pitched.
The death spiral was a positive feedback loop where the price of UST decreased, so LUNA increased
and more users sold. More users selling decreased UST even more which further increased
LUNA and so on and so forth. This is like the toilet paper scare during early covid. People
heard toilet paper was low, so they bought more, which caused even lower supplies which caused
even more panic buying. The government, or system, can stop this spiral with a large, well-timed
injection of cash or product into the economy. If the Terra organization had enough reserves,
they could have bought the falling UST which would drive up prices and stop the spiral.
However even still this may not have worked if they did not have enough cash, which was the case.
In the 1970s, the USA was faced with high inflation and decided to drop the gold standard it
was pegged to. Terra was far too new and unadopted, relative to fiat currency, to be even remotely
close to doing something like this. UST lost its peg and became useless, the USD dropped its peg
and stayed strong.
<p />
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Where is Terra Now?</b><p /></div>
The only point of UST was its peg and without it, became useless. LUNA is still a representation
of mining power of the Terra blockchain so it still trades around $0.05 at the time of writing.
The Terra organization is attempting to release a new version of LUNA and start over. They are
also under investigation from the Korean government for their blunder. Governments around the
world are looking into laws to better regulate the stablecoin space. The fall of Terra is most
likely going to take away some autonomy from the crypto space. The whole Terra landscape almost
seemed like a Ponzi scheme. Early investors were offered 20% returns which was piad for by
later investors. Terra claimed that the de-pegging was a targeted attack, but most likely it was
simply investors seeing a weakness and exploiting it.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Outlook on Stablecoin Crypto Space</b><p /></div>
The motivation for Bitcoin was to remove the government from financial transactions. It was to
decentralize the monetary devices. The word "decentralize" is a major buzzword in the crypto
industry. The idea is that many users maintain the blockchain, rather than a central authority.
However, as we can see, it was only about 4 or 5 accounts that took down all of Terra. How can
something be so "decentralized" yet a few accounts hold so much wealth and power. How is this
any different than a handful of billionaires controlling the governments with lobbyists.
Billionaires are unelected just the same as the Terra attackers. The crypto space is full of
Ponzi schemes, get-rich-quick, and the likes.
<p />
An important question to ask, do we actually need a stablecoin? If the Dollar is backed by
nothing, they why does a cryptocurrency need to be backed by anything? If the Dollar is simply
worth a Dollar, then can a Bitcoin be simply worth a Bitcoin? The Dollar cannot even be related
to a cup of coffee because over time, the cup of coffee increases in price without increasing in
value.
<p />
Stablecoins are a stepping stone to crypto-adoption because people want their coins to be worth
a Dollar even though the Dollar is only worth what we think it is. The fall of Terra showed
the flaws in the cryptosphere and furthermore showed that even in the "decentralized" world
of crypto, there are still just a few actors controlling the economy. The top 1% of Americans
own about 30% of all the wealth whilst the top 0.01% of Bitcoin holders own about 27% of
all the Bitcoin.<sup>[4]</sup>
<p />
This project started as curiosity with stablecoins and the math behind them, however it has
unveiled some nasty characteristics of decentralized finance which I am starting to suspect
is a feature, not a bug.
