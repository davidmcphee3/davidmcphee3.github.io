On June 18th, David embarked on his 5 week journey to Malaysia for work. Which meant Anne and I were left without our captain. At first we just kind of looked at each other then we had some ideas!
<p />
For the first week Anne and I stayed in Saskatoon. We made sure to book lots of playdates to keep ourselves busy and distracted from missing daddy too much. On June 24th, late into the evening, grandma Pauly arrived! We spent the next few days catching up and exploring Saskatoon a bit. On Monday June 27th (Anne’s 8 month birthday) we left for a road trip to Calgary. Anne wasn’t a huge fan of the car but Grandma did a wonderful job of keeping her entertained the 600km. We even had a picnic in Rosetown. Anne appreciated getting to stretch her legs. 
<p />
Our first day in Calgary was spent playing at the park and in the inflatable pool auntie Abby bought for Anne. Auntie Faith came over to join in the fun. The next day, uncle Simon suggested a library trip! Anne had lots of fun in the baby crawling area and met a friend named Mila. She appreciated the books that we picked out for her. We rented the most awesome book titled “Goldilocks for Dinner”. It became my new favorite children's book. 
<p />
Things got even more exciting the next day with another suggestion from uncle Simon, the ZOO! Auntie Faith joined us and we got to see the penguins, monkeys, giraffes and more. Anne was more interested in chewing her hands than observing the animals. 
<p />
July 1st, Anne’s first Canada day! We celebrated at Mucho burrito meeting up with great aunties Anna and Rena, and great uncles Tim and Chris. Anne even got to enjoy some of my burrito! It was so nice to catch up with family and for them to hold Anne again. 
<p />
Saturday July 2nd was filled with rest in preparation for Sunday. On Sunday, we spent the day wedding dress and bridesmaids dress shopping for Faith’s wedding next summer! I think grandma Pauly especially enjoyed the day and she was put on Anne duty for most of it. Auntie Faith was so beautiful in every single one. 
<p />
Monday and Tuesday were spent at the library and park. Wednesday was exciting as we got to meet baby Reagan and Katelynd at the science center. There was a crawling track for the girls which was perfect timing as Anne had just started figuring out how to take off.
<p />
July 7th was another exciting day as we met an old friend at the music center! Baby Yuri and Anne enjoyed playing with some balloon instruments together as Jessica and I caught up and shared our testimonies together. 
<p />
Grandma and gramps Pauly met us for lunch on Saturday at good earth. We had way too much fun and I truly thought gramps was going to steal my baby. She would be in good hands if he did so I guess it wasn’t too much to worry about.  
<p />
On July 10th, we celebrated Bumpa’s (Anne’s great grandpa’s) 80th birthday party! We went to a locked room and then had chinese food and cupcakes back at the McPhees. 
<p />
And then…. We caught a cold. So the next week we layed low at home while granny and grandpa McPhee took care of us. 
<p />
On Friday July 15th, we called in auntie Faith to babysit because the McPhees were going to Hamilton!!!! It was everything I imagined and more. 
<p />
On saturday July 16th we had a very important celebration. It would have been my cousin Chelsea’s 25th birthday so we had ice cream for dessert to honor her. We miss her so much. 
<p />
On Monday July 18th, we met up with Julianna at a cafe called Monogram! Julianna is such an amazing friend and role model to me. Our visits are never long enough. Back in February she did a fundraiser for Ukraine and made Anne a beautiful Vinok. 
<p />
Auntie Faith’s (to be) inlaws wanted to meet Anne and we thought this was a perfect opportunity to also have a slumber party at her house. We arrived on July 19th and had an evening full of playing, pizza eating and wedding planning. She lives in a lake community so the next day we spent the afternoon at the lake. There was also a spray park there which Anne was pretty indifferent to. 
<p />
On Friday July 22nd, we went to the Glenmore spray park with baby Yuri and Jessica. Both of the girls seemed to have a good time sitting in the little baby pool and swinging on the swings. 
<p />
We spent the next couple of days packing and preparing for our road trip back to Calgary as DADDY WAS COMING HOME! Grandpa McPhee drove us back out to Saskatoon and the road trip was seamless. 
<p />
We are so grateful that daddy had this idea to send us to Calgary to keep busy and spend so much time with family and friends. Granny and grandpa were so generous and hospitable for allowing us to stay with them and helping out so much with Anne. Granny gave Annie a sink bath every single night and Anne really learned how to enjoy bath time with her granny. 
<p />
Although we had a blast in Calgary, it feels really good for the three of us to be together in Saskatoon again.
