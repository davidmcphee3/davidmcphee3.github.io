<div class="bTitle"><p><u><strong>The Gambler's Ruin</strong></u><p /></div>
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/gamblersruin/thumbnail.png" alt="Thumbnail for The Gambler's Ruin"></img>
The Gambler's Ruin is a statistical concept that is used to prove the security of Bitcoin and other
blockchain-based technologies. This concept lacks explanation and proof in the Bitcoin whitepaper. The thumbnail
graph and equation will be fully explored to prove the validity and clear ambiguities.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>The Motivation</b><p /></div>
Whilst reading the <a href="https://davidmcphee.ca/includes/projects/cryptominer/bitcoinwhitepaper.pdf">Bitcoin Whitepaper</a>,
there was a section that involved proving the sercuity of the blockchain. The blockchain is maintained by nodes (CPUs, computers, etc)
and the author of the paper claims that so long as more than 51% of the nodes are honest, the blockchain is secure. The paper then
explains compares this to the Gambler's Ruin and shows the equation in the thumbnail with no other context. For clairty in
<a href="https://davidmcphee.ca/cryptominer.html">this project</a>, I created and provided a plot of the equation. For me this
actually made things more confusing and I spent a couple of nights awake thinking about it.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>The Blockchain Problem</b><p /></div>
On the blockchain the longest chain is the accepted chain. Transactions can be altered somewhat by attackers but the catch is that they
have to shorten their chain. Since the altered chain is shorter than the unaltered chain, the altered chain is considered invalid and
none of their altered transactions will be reconigzed. If they are somehow able to get their chain longer than the unaltered chain, then
their chain becomes the accepted chain and thus they have successful stolen bitcoin.<p />
The blockchain is lengthened by node guessing the right answer to a complex problem. For the sake of the Gambler's Ruin, the percentage of
honest nodes is represented by <i>p</i> and the percentage of dishonest nodes <i>q</i>. These definitiions imply that<p />
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/gamblersruin/img1.png" alt="1 = p + q"></img>
We can assume that the attackers are <i>z</i> blocks behind the honest nodes. What is the probability that the attacking nodes will ever
catch up to the honest nodes?
<div class="bSub"><p><b>The Gambler's Ruin</b><p /></div>
The Gambler's Ruin is a concept that states that a gambler starts with 1 penny and on each betting round either wins or loses a penny.
The gambler is betting on a weighted coin flip and bets heads every time. This means that there is a <i>r</i> chance it lands on heads
and a <i>s</i> chance it lands on tails. This implies:
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/gamblersruin/img2.png" alt="1 = r + s"></img>
What are the odds that the gambler attains a forture of <i>N</i> pennies before getting ruined (i.e going broke)?
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Combining the Two</b><p /></div>
These two statistical events seem related but the differences are important. In the blockchain example, the attacker is at a deficit of blocks
relative to the honest nodes and is trying to get to a zero block deficit. This is the opposite of the gambler who starts at a surplus and is
trying <i>not</i> to reach 0 pennies. With each example there is also the other perspective. In the blockchain example the honest nodes are
trying to be an infinite number of blocks ahead of the attackers before the attackers catch up. This perspective sounds a lot more like the
gambler. OK, so the gambler and the honest nodes are the same, for now lets assume that the honest nodes only need to get <i>N</i> blocks
ahead of the attackers.<p />
The blockchain problem can now be thought of as a weighted coin-flip where agian <i>p</i> is the weight of the side that the honest nodes pick and
<i>q</i> is the weight of the side that the attackers pick. For simplicity lets assume the honest nodes always pick heads and dishonest nodes
always pick tails. The honest nodes start <i>z</i> blocks ahead of the dishonest nodes and are trying to reach <i>N</i> nodes ahead before the
attackers catch up.
