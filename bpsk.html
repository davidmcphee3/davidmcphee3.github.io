           <p>

            The Binary Phase Key Shifting is a modulation technique used in satellite communications, bluetooth, etc.
            Modulation works by combining a carrier signal with a stream of digital bits. The resulting spectrum (as 
            seen in the thumbnail) show that the BPSK signal occupies more than just the carrier frequency. It is a 
            set of rolling hills with nulls (zero-crossings) at the symbol rate. We can rebuild this spectrum in python 
            and explain why:
            <ol>
              <li>The spectrum is wider than just the carrier frequency</li>
              <li>What is actually contained in the rolling hills</li>
              <li>Why there are nulls at the symbol rate offset to the carrier frequency</li>
            </ol>

            We will start with looking at the signals in the time domain and how each is built. We will look at each part 
            and explain what is contributes to the BPSK signal. We will then talk about convolution and Fourier Transforms 
            as we convert to the Frequency Domain. Finally we rebuild the BPSK wave and in doing so, understand the key 
            characteristics of it. After the waveform is built some questions will arise such as, what about higher forms of
            modulation, modulation index, subcarriers etc.

            <div class="bSub"><p><b>The Time Domain</b></p></div>

            As mentioned previously, modulation is the act of combining a carrier wave with a data wave. There are numerous benefits
            to do this such as specifying the frequency of your data. Imagine if 10 people had bluetooth headphones and their phones
            where all transmitting data to their headpones on the same frequency, this would lead to confusion and mixed signals. By
            modulating our data to a specific frequency, we can avoid these issues. 

            The Carrier Wave can be any sine wave we choose. The exact frequency isn't important for demonstration and will change based 
            on which aspects of the signal I am trying to emphisze. Here is an example of a carrier sine wave:
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img1.png" alt="zoomed in sine wave"></img>
            We can see that the period of the sine wave is 0.2 seconds (how long it takes for the wave to repeat). Therefore the frequency
            of this wave is 5 Hz. 

            The Data Wave is a series of binary numbers, 0s and 1s. We will encode this data such that the 0s are -1s (Non-return to zero), but it will 
            still look the same as a normal set of 0s and 1s. Real world binary data has two key characteristics: it is inifintly long, 
            and it is random. These might seem like extreme assumptions, however, typical phone plans have data speeds on the order of 
            Mbvscode-remote://wsl%2Bubuntu-20.04/home/dmcphee/bpsk_demo/plot1_simple_time_domain.pngps which means 1,000,000 bits per second. Even over 1 minute, over 60,000,000 bits of data are sent. With 60 million bits,
            we can easily make the jump to 'infinite'. Data is random in the same way that the digits of pi are random. Yes we can calculate
            the digits of pi, but we can also find any string of numbers we want in pi. So sufficently long binary data will contain 
            at least example patterns of [1,0,1,0], [1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0], [1,1,0,1,1,0], etc. Here is an example of some NRZ binary data:
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img2.png" alt="zoomed in NRZ binary wave"></img>

            The BPSK Wave is the multiplication of the Carrier Wave and the Data wave. If the data wave was all 1s, the BPSK wave 
            would look identical to the carrier wave. If the data wave was all 0s, the BPSK wave would be an upsidedown version of 
            the carrier wave. Another way to this about this is that when the binary data is -1, the wave is shift 180 degrees. This 
            is where the name comes from "Binary" "Phase" Key "Shifting".
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img3.png" alt="BPSK of all 1s"></img>
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img4.png" alt="BPSK of all 0s"></img>

            Now lets look what happens when we use a combination of 0s and 1s for the data. We can see that as the data flips between 
            -1 and 1, the sine wave is shifted forward and backward 180 degrees. 
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img5.png" alt="Random BPSK, pi/2 crossing"></img>

            There are two more aspects of the BPSK wave to talk about. The first is how often we change between -1 and 1 and the second is
            when we change between -1 and 1. The answer to the first question is called the symbol rate. We can see that the data changes 
            from a 1 to a -1 at the 0.1 second mark and then back to 1 at the 0.2 second mark. This shows that our symbol rate is 0.1 seconds. We can 
            change when the binary data changes the BPSK by shifting our carrier phase. It leads to some interesting BPSK spectrum, but the 
            information carried is still the same:
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img6.png" alt="Random BPSK, 0 crossing"></img>
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img7.png" alt="Random BPSK, pi/3 crossing"></img>

            We have successfully built a BPSK signal. However this does not look like the thumbnail. That is because this is in the time 
            domain and we need to convert to the frequency domain. We need to convert the carrier wave and the data wave to the frequency 
            domain using Fourier Transforms and then we need to convole them together. We need to use convolution rather than multiplication 
            thanks to the convolution theorem which states that: multiplication in the time/frequency domain is convolution in the frequency/time domain.

            <div class="bSub"><p><b>The Frequency Domain (Square Waves)</b></p></div>
            The Frequency Domain represents which frequencies are present in a signal. In this domain, the x-axis is frequency rather than 
            time. For a sine-wave (a single frequency signal), the plot in the frequency domain only has one point and that is at the 
            frequency of the sine wave.
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img8.png" alt="Carrier FFT"></img>
            You wil notice that there are actually two peaks, one at 2500 Hz and another at -2500 Hz. That is because a negative frequency looks 
            the same as a positive frequency, although negavtive frequencies do not exist. It is more common to show Fourier Transform 
            results starting at zero.
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img9.png" alt="Carrier FFT starting at zero"></img>
            In summary, the Fourier Series shows the frequencies components that make up the wave. 

            What does the Fourier Series of our data wave look like? Lets start with the simple case where our data is alternating 0s and 1s,
            a square wave. 
            <div class="bSub"><p><b>A Dive into the Fourier Series of a Square Wave</b></p></div>
            A square wave has a Fourier Series that has energy at the symbol frequency, and every odd harmonic (multiple) of the 
            symbol frequency. For a symbol frequency of 25 (and thus a symbol rate of 50), we should expect peaks at 25, 75, 125, etc. 
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img10.png" alt="A Square Wave with Symobl Frequency 25"></img>
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img11.png" alt="FFT of a Square Wave with Symbol Frequeny 25"></img>
            What does this really mean? It means that 
            
            f(x) = sin(25*x) + sin(50*x) + ... equals a square wave. 

            To fully appriecant this concept, we need to derive the formula using the Fourier Series Equation. If you recall, the 
            Foruier Series is an expansion of a periodic function in terms of infinite sums of sines and cosines. (I would love 
            to prove this formula but we really don't have time...)
            
            <img class="bEqu" src="/includes/other/bpsk/equ2.png" alt="Fourier Series"></img>

            where the variables are defined as 

            <img class="bEqu" src="/includes/other/bpsk/equ3.png" alt="Variables of the Fourier Series"></img>

            Mathematically we can describe a square wave as

            <img class="bEqu" src="/includes/other/bpsk/equ4.png" alt="Piecewise Function of a Square Wave"></img>

            To start solving the coefficents we can start with a0. This equation is the integral from -L to L, multipled
            by a constant. Visually we can see from the plot (where L = 0.04), that for half a period (-L to 0), the plot 
            is negative and for the other have, it is positive. This means that the net area is 0 and therefore in the integral 
            is 0 and finally, a0 = 0. One oefficient down, two infinities to go.

            Starting with <i>an</i>, we can split the integral into to parts, one for the negative piecewise (where 
            <itlatics>f(x) = -1</itlatics>) and the positive piecewise (<i>f(x) = 1</i>).

            <img class="bEqu" src="/includes/other/bpsk/equ5.png" alt="Fourier Series A0 definition"></img>
            <img class="bEqu" src="/includes/other/bpsk/equ6.png" alt="Fourier Series an solved"></img>
            
            Therefore all <i>an</i> are equal to zero and thus there are no cosines in the Fourier Series of a 
            square wave.

            Moving onto the <i>bn</i> coefficents, we follow the same logic in solving these:
            <img class="bEqu" src="/includes/other/bpsk/equ7.png" alt="Fourier Series bn solved"></img>

            Something interesting is noted for this step. Since <i>n</i> is all natural numbers and cosine is periodic about 2 pi, we 
            end up with just two options for <i>bn</i>. The first case is where <i>n</i> is odd, in which case the cosine reduces to -1. 
            In the even case, the cosine reduces to 1. Simplifying further:
            <img class="bEqu" src="/includes/other/bpsk/equ8.png" alt="Fourier Series bn piecewise"></img>

            Putting these back into the Fourier Series equation:
            <img class="bEqu" src="/includes/other/bpsk/equ8.png" alt="Fourier Series of a Square"></img>

            If we start to plot the induvidual components of the Fourier Series, we see that as <i>n</i> increases, the frequency of the 
            component increases, but each sine wave continues to have a null at <i>L, -L, 2*L, -2*L, etc</i>. 
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img12.png" alt="Fourier Series of a Square wave, carpenmentilzed"></img>

            As we add these sine waves together, the shape of the square wave begins to form. The Fourier Series <i>n</i>
            increases in each plot from 1, 5, 9, to 13. Two important notes about this graph, we see that the nulls of the 
            fundamental frequency persist, and two, the entire plot is sine waves with increaseing frequency,
            1/L, 3/L, 5/L. 
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img13.png" alt="Fourier Series of a Square wave, increasing size of n"></img>

            As we convert the time series of a square wave to the Frequency domain, we expect to see tones at 1/L, 3/L, 5/L, etc. Which 
            is what we saw at the beginning of this section for a L of 0.04 so the tones are 25, 75, 125, etc.
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img11.png" alt="FFT of a Square Wave with Symbol Frequeny 25"></img>

            <div class="bSub"><p><b>BPSK of a Square Wave</b></p></div>
            We now have our Fourier Series for the Carrier and Data waves. To finally get the BPSK wave, in the time domain we
            multiplied these arrays but since we are in the Frequency domain, we will have to take the convolution. In simple terms,
            the convoultion just re-centers the data wave so that its 0 point is now at the carrier frequency. Since the carrier 
            frequency is much higher than 0, we can again show the (formerally) negative side of the plot because it is now a 
            offset of the carrier frequency.
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img14.png" alt="Frequency Domain of a Square Wave"></img>

            We see the same tones now but as an offset to the carrier frequency. Instead of +-25, +-75, +-125, we see 
            2500+-25, 2500+-75, 2500+-125 or 2325, 2375, 2425, 2475, 2525, 2575, 2625, 2675. This is our BPSK signal 
            from the thumbnail and we do see nulls at integer multiples of the symbol rate (50), but it doesn't look "filled-in". This 
            is because of the assumption we made about the data being square waves. 

            The data, since it's random and infinite, is actually a superposition of rectangular waves. Our square wave (L = 1) has a 
            series like [1,0,1,0], L = 2 looks like [1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0] and so on for increasing L. 

            <div class="bSub"><p><b>The Frequency Domain (Retangular Waves)</b></p></div>
            We can revisit the derived equations for the Fourier Series of a Square wave and use L = 2 (or higher) instead of L = 1. 
            Once we solve this equation, we can then combine our square and retangle wave to get closer to the real BPSK signal. 

            One the left is the Fourier Series of the superposition rectangle waves with increasing complexity and on the left is 
            the BPSK signal. The nulls at the integer multiples of the symbol rate persist and the "hills" are starting to take shape.
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img15a.png" alt="Frequency Domain of a Square Wave (1,2)"></img>
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img15b.png" alt="Frequency Domain of a Square Wave (1,2,3)"></img>
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img15c.png" alt="Frequency Domain of a Square Wave (1,2,3,4)"></img>

            Finally we compare the superposition of retangular waves up to the order L = 6 against random data. The two plots are starting 
            to look very similar to eachother as well as the thumbnail. 
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img16a.png" alt="Frequency Domain of a Square Wave (1,2,3,4,5,6)"></img>
            <img class="bImg" src="/includes/other/bpsk/img16b.png" alt="Frequency Domain of Random Data"></img>

            Can we prove that there will never be a sine component of the square/rectangle waves with a frequency of that of the 
            symbol rate (or integer multiple therefore?).

            <div class="bSub"><p><b>Conclusion and More Questions</b></p></div>
            We can now revisit our original questions with some answers

            <ol>
                <li>The spectrum is wider than just the carrier frequency <i>because</i> the data signal is a superposition of 
                retangular waves with periods of integer multiples of the symbol rate.</li>
                <li>The data in the rolling hills are a result of the sine wavs that make up the rectangular waves.</li>
                <li>The nulls at the integer multiples of the symbol rate are because through the derivation of the Fourier Series
                    of a rectanglur wave, we calculated that it is a summation of sine waves with odd integer multiples of the inverse 
                    of the symbol rate (and integer multiples of). 
                </li>
              </ol>

            There are questions that come out of this solution such as: can we send more than 1 bit per symbol (yes its called 
            QPSK) can we maintain the carrier while also setting data (yes, its called a residuel carrier and modulation index). 
            This is just the starting point to digital modulation.
