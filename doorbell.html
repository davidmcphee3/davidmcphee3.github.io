<div class="bTitle"><p><u><strong>OLED Doorbell</strong></u><p /></div>
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/doorbell/thumbnail.png" alt="Thumbnail for OLED doorbell"></img>
This is a OLED attachment to the doorbell to display messages and images. It is connected via WiFi
and can be controlled via a phone with internet. This all started with the wife needing a way to
stop people from ringing the doorbell whilst Anne was sleeping.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Parts List</b><p /></div>
Here is the list of materials and tools used for this project. Arduino software
as well as FreeCAD was used for the programming and 3D design, respectively.
<div class="cText"><p />
1. ESP 8266 Microcontroller with WiFi<p />
2. Adafruit 128x64 OLED screen<p />
3. Custom 3D printed case<p />
4. Cables and soldering<p />
3. Multimeter / Oscilloscope<p /></div>
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Hardware</b><p /></div>
The ESP 8266 microcontroller is a good choice for this project because it has a large RAM,
WiFi enabled, and small form-factor. The Adafruit OLED has pins for serial connection
and power supply from the ESP board. These two pieces of hardware were connected with
via a breadboard for the software design and integration.
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/doorbell/img1.jpg" alt="Hardware on breadboard"></img>
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Software</b><p /></div>
The ESP board uses C code and was coded with the Ardunio IDE. To enable WiFi communication,
the ESP8266WebServer library was used to initialize the controller. The board first
initializes the OLED screen and then attempts to connect to the WiFi network. After
a successful connection, the URL is printed on the OLED screen. The server (ESP board)
waits until another computer requests an http connection at which point it sends the
index page. <a href="/includes/projects/doorbell/example_doorbell_index.html">Here</a> is an
example of the webpage hosted by the ESP board. The page has three different options to
display messages on the OLED screen. The first two large buttons for quick messages.
When a user selects a button, the approprite text is written to the OLED screen and a
conformation page is sent back to the user. The second message option is custom text.
The custom text is entered by the user and sent to the server to display on the OLED.
The final message type is an image. These images are preset but can be altered within
the ardunio code. Users cannot upload images due to the lack of RAM on the ESP board.
The bitmaps of the preset images are stored in the bitmaps.h file on the github repo and
can be changed using <a href="/includes/projects/doorbell/image2oled.html">this tool</a>
that I have published on this website.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>3D Design and Printing</b><p /></div>
The plan for this project was to mount the OLED attachment to the doorbell which meant
it would be outside and for everyone to see. Therefore presentation is important which
meant that I could not just shove it in a recycled container and nail it to the wall.
I used FreeCAD 0.19 which worked very well and I highly recommend it for anyone looking
to create something similar in scale. I followed a couple of tutorials and soon enough
I had a good design. The local library has a 3D printer and it only cost $4 which is
significantly cheaper than buying my own 3D printer. The first interation was okay but the
lid was too big for the box and did not slide on. I went back to freeCAD and added some
margin for machine-error and tried again. This time the lid did fit which made me pleased.
