    <p>Hi, I am David McPhee. Over the past few years I have been designing and 
      building satellites, specifically the RF subsystem. I got a degree in 
      Engineering Physics at the University of Saskatchewan in 2021 and moved 
      down to Long Beach in early 2024 to work in the Space Systems division of Rocket Lab.</p>
  
    <p>As an engineer, I find it hard to stop working on problems, even on the weekends
    and evenings. To leave a paper trail and share my projects with others, I have them
    all stored in the <a href="projects">Projects</a> page.</p>
  
    <p>I also have been exploring a variety of topics that are less hands-on. These 
      are like projects, but for the mind <a href="other">Ideas</a> page.</p>
