<div class="bTitle"><p><u><strong>Mining Crypto, A Bitcoin Explainer</strong></u><p /></div>
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/cryptominer/thumbnail.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for cryptominer"></img>
For this project a raspberry pi will be converted to a miner, working with a pool of others to solve
cryptographic puzzles. To fully understand this process we must start with the whitepaper.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>The Bitcoin Whitepaper</b><p /></div>
A whitepaper is a document that is produced to define and explain an idea or project at "high-level". The paper was written
by a person (or group) named Satoshi Nakamoto. The main problem that this paper attempts solves is how to remove the third
party from financial transactions. When people exchange electronic money, they need the banks to record it on a ledger. The
banks verify the purchase and maintain the ledger. Through the use of digital signatures people can verify their own transactions,
but cannot maintain a common ledger. This common ledger problem is solved using what is known as a blockchain.<p />
The blockchain is a list of time-stamped transactions that are verified in a peer-to-peer network using Proof of Work (PoW).
Computers compete to verify the block the quickest to add it to the chain. The longest chain is considered valid which means so
as long as less than 51% of the computers are bad actors, only valid transactions will be recorded.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>The Introduction</b><p /></div>
Using cash as a medium for trade can be secure, anonymous, trustless, and irreversible, however it only works for in-person or
local transactions. This system worked great for awhile, but globalization took over and now anything can be bought from anywhere
for the lowest price. The solution for internet transactions involves banks serving as third parties in the verification and maintenance
of the ledger. The ledger is a history of all transactions made using the bank. We can think of all the banks of the world as just one
bank, the third party bank. <p />
<div class="cText"><p />
<b>The Double-Spending Example Without a Third Party</b><i><p/></div>
Abby finds a $10 bill on the ground<p />
Abby calls Matthew and promises to give $10 if Matthew gives her a clue for the Daily Wordle<p />
Matthew agrees and gives Abby a clue and will get the $10 the next time they meet up<p />
Abby still cannot figure out the Wordle so she calls Simon and makes the same deal<p />
Simon agrees to give Abby a clue because he is not aware that Abby already promised the $10 to Matthew<p />
</i>
Even if Matthew and Simon figure out that Abby double-spent her money, it is too late, the boys cannot take back the clues they gave her.
A solution to this problem is to involve a third party, the bank.
<div class="cText"><p />
<b>The Double-Spending Example With a Third Party</b><i></div>
Abby finds a $10 bill on the ground<p />
Abby calls Matthew and offers $10 if Matthew gives her a clue for the Daily Wordle<p />
Matthew agrees and tells Abby to send him the money first<p />
Abby goes to the bank and deposits the $10<p />
The bank then gives Matthew the $10<p />
After Matthew sees the money he gives Abby the clue<p />
Abby still cannot figure out the Wordle so she calls Simon and makes the same deal<p />
Simon agrees and tells Abby to send him the money first<p />
Abby tells the bank to give Simon $10, but since the bank knows Abby already spent it, they refuse the transaction<p />
Simon doesn't receive the money so he doesn't give Abby the clue<p />
</i>
In this scenario, the boys only accept money that has come from the bank. This third party system requires both the buyer and seller
to trust the bank to maintain the ledger. The bank knew that Abby already spent the money because they can look back in their records.
An obvious question arises: What if Matthew accepts the money but doesn't give Abby a clue?<br>
This forces the bank to take on another role, mediator. Abby can dispute the transaction and if she can prove Matthew didn't give her
a clue then the bank can reverse the transaction. Overall the third party must be trusted, know the identities of all parties, and have
the ability to reverse transactions. The third party gets a lot of trust and personal information from the participates just for acting
as a middleman of a transaction. In this system some fraud is unavoidable because transactions are not instant like in cash trades.
Two people can physically swap goods but the same is not true on the internet.<p />
The paper proposes a solution that replaces trust with cryptographic proof. In this context, "cryptographic" means irreversible calculations.
More simply it means that the only way to get proof of the transaction is by actually doing the transaction. People cannot fake transactions
that didn't happen because they do not have the cryptographic proof.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>The Transactions</b><p /></div>
A "bitcoin" is defined as a series of transactions. This means that a "bitcoin" is not a physical coin or even a digital image of a coin rather
it <i>is</i> the combination of all of the previous transactions/transfers. Each transfer adds and updates the coins data. An obvious question
is what is a transaction? The white paper includes this image:
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/cryptominer/img1.png" alt="Transaction image from bitcoin white paper"></img>
It is best to go through each term and fully define it.<p />
Every account (or person, but a person can have many accounts) has a Public/Private Key pair. The Public Key (PK) is public knowledge but this
doesn't mean that there is an identity attached to it. Rather it means that a certain transaction used this PK. The Private(Secret) Key (SK)
is secret and should never be shared with anyone, ever. An example of a transaction is:<br>
<i>Abby gives Matthew $10</i><p />
This example transaction can be combined with Abbys PK to make a hash, lets label it called TR. Abby must sign this transaction, meaning that
she in fact does want to transfer $10 to Matthew. The signature is created using Abby's SK (this is why the SK must remain secret, or anyone
could fake your signature). An example of Abby's signature is:<br>
<i>TR + SK = Signature</i><p />
More formally TR and SK are inputs to a cryptographic function. Recall that a cryptographic function means it can be computed one way but not the
other. Imagine a machine that takes two inputs (TR and SK) and outputs a Signature:
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/cryptominer/img2.png" alt="cryptographic function visual"></img>
The machine is called SHA and only works one way which means the SK cannot be reversed calculated. Even though the TR, SHA function, and the
Signature are all known, the SK cannot be calculated. This means that if there is a signed transaction, it is extremely unlikely for it to be
fraudulent. More formally the signature equation looks like this:<br>
<i>SHA(TR, SK) = Signature</i><p />
Another question, how is the signature verified if the SK is unknown. That is where the PK comes in to create a second equation. The PK and
the signature goes into a verification function, VER, that returns either true or false. Since all variables are known to the public there is no
need for it to be too complicated:
<i>VER(Signature, PK) = True or False</i><p />
These two equations are great for verifying transactions but they cannot verify that Abby hasn't sent the same $10 to two different people. Since
a coin is just a list of previous transactions, it can fork into two different chains of transactions and the receivers may never know. This
again can be solved with the bank. If all transactions must go through the bank, the bank can check its ledger to verify no coin was double-spent.
The only way for everyone to know about all transactions without the use of a third party is to publicly announce each transaction and agree on a
public ledger. There needs to be a way to know which transaction was first and also that all (valid) transactions get included on the ledger.
This could mean that everyone puts each transaction on a website, but that involves a third party, the websites webmaster.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>The Timestamp Server</b><p /></div>
The solution to the double-spend problem is to add a timestamp so the order in which transactions happen are known. This solves the issues of
transactions happening in quick succession. The paper suggests to take many items, forming a block, and taking the hash of the block. The hash is
then annouced publicly. Recall that hashs are one-way functions, so the only way to produce the hash would be for the transactions to actually happen.
A block in the case of Bitcoin contains 2,400 transactions and the hash of the previous block. The inclusion of the previous hash means that all the
transactions in the previous hash must have happened before the transactions in the current hash. Since the only way to get a hash is for the previous
transactions to have actually happened, we know that the previous block happened before the current block. This solves the problem of the double-spend
because the history of the transactions are now publicly known. Each of the blocks are connected to the previous because they contain the hash of the
previous block. This mains a chain of blocks or a <i>blockchain</i>.<p />
There is still one major problem with this solution, how do we know which chain is the real chain? Let's say Abby transfered Simon $1,000 dollars. Since
Abby is sending the money, she needs to sign the transaction with her private key, pretty straightforward. After that transaction 15 more blocks of
transactions have been added to the chain. Abby nows tries to steal Simons money by going back 15 blocks and changing the transaction to say $1 instead
of $1,000. She then adds the same 15 blocks to the alterd transaction. We now have two chains of equal length and the only difference is that single
transaction 15 blocks ago. The solution to this problem is to always assume that the longest blockchain is correct AND make it hard for blocks to be
added to the chain. If we go back to the example, Abby has to add 15 blocks to her altered transaction whislt the unaltered chain is 15 blocks ahead. This
means that everyone will ignore Abby's shorter, altered chain and opt for the longer, unaltered chain. If blocks are hard to add then Abby will have a tricky
time catching up and overtaking the unaltered chain. Now, how do we make it hard to add blocks to the chain?
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Proof of Work</b><p /></div>
Remember Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network which means that the transactions, blocks, are added by people like you or me. More formally CPUs maintain the
blockchain that we control. We can make it hard to add blocks if we force the CPU to solve a complex problem before being allowed to add a block to the chain.
This complex problem is so hard that the computers simply need to guess the answer randomly until they get it. This complex problem can be modified so that on
average all the CPUs contributing to the blockchain take about 10 minutes to solve it and thus add a block to the chain. Only a single CPU needs to find the right
answer because then they tell everyone else because the are proving that they did the work to add the block. Lets go back to the stealing example. If there are
10 CPUs maintaining the blockchain, including Abby's, then on average the complex problem will take 10 CPUs about 10 minutes to solve. When Abby goes back 15
blocks to alter the transaction, she needs to create 15 new blocks to catch up with the unaltered chain. Since Abby only has 1 CPU it will taker her ~10x longer
to solve the problem and add a block to her altered chain. There is no way that Abby will be able to catch up with only 1 CPU and thus the fraud cannot occur.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>The Complex Problem</b><p /></div>
What problem is so hard that a computer just has to guess? A cryptographic equation! If we give the CPU the hash and the input message for the first equation
exampled, then the only way to find the private key is to guess and check. In this case the message is the block and the hash is a 256-bit number will x leading
zeros where x is a varying number between 0 and 256. The higher the x, the harder the problem. The more nodes trying to solve the problem, the higher x goes.
Running CPUs take power and effort so how are these CPUs (other names: nodes/miners) rewarded for their honest efforts?
<div class="bSub"><p><b>The Incentive</b><p /></div>
The lucky CPU to actually solve the complex problem gets to place a block on the chain. The reason why this is a good thing is because the first transaction of a
given block is a reward transaction. The transaction is simply that the node gives themselves a set amount of bitcoin. This means that nodes earn bitcoin for
maintaining the blockchain. People transfering bitcoin to eachother can also "tip" the miners. This tip is another reward for their efforts. The set amount of bitcoin
that a node receives for adding a block goes down as the total supply of bitcoin goes up until a limit and then there is no reward for adding a block. The miners then
have to fully rely on tips. This bitcoin limit is estimated to be reached in the 2100s (21 million bitcoin).<p />
The paper also theorizes that this incentive will encourage nodes to refain from trying to steal. This is because they can either direct their CPU toward stealing or mining.
If they steal, they make the average bitcoin user weary of the asset. But if they simply mine then they are rewarded with bitcoin. Their stealing may undermine and devalue
the exact asset that they are trying to get more of whislt mining strengthens the asset.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>The Network</b><p /></div>
The paper explains the bitcoin protocal in this way:<br>
1. New transactions are broadcast to all nodes<br>
2. Each node collects 2,400 transactions to make a block<br>
3. Each node then trys to solve the complex problem of their block<br>
4. Once a node solves the problem they broadcast the block and the answer to all the other nodes<br>
5. All other nodes verify the block and start working on the next one<p />
Nodes always work on the longest chain. If two chains are tied then nodes chose whichever chain to mine on and eventually one chain will become longer than the other.
So long as 51% of the nodes are honest, then the true chain will be longer and will always be considerd correct. The more and more blocks added after a transactions, the more
sure the participates can be that the transaction is valid. Because ofthe 51% rule it is okay if some of the nodes miss the most recent block because once they do finally get
a new block they will relize they are missing one and request it from other nodes. They will know they are missing a block because the hash of the previous block is stored
within the current block.
