<div class="bTitle"><p><u><strong>Mining Crypto, A Bitcoin Explainer</strong></u><p /></div>
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/cryptominer/thumbnail.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for cryptominer"></img>
For this project a raspberry pi will be converted to a miner, working with a pool of others to solve
cryptographic puzzles. To fully understand this process we must start with the whitepaper.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>The Bitcoin Whitepaper</b><p /></div>
A whitepaper is a document that is produced to define and explain an idea or project at "high-level". The paper was written
by a person (or group) named Satoshi Nakamoto. The main problem that this paper attempts solves is how to remove the third
party from financial transactions. When people exchange electronic money, they need the banks to record it on a ledger. The
banks verify the purchase and maintain the ledger. Through the use of digital signatures people can verify their own transactions,
but cannot maintain a common ledger. This common ledger problem is solved using what is known as a blockchain.<p />
The blockchain is a list of time-stamped transactions that are verified in a peer-to-peer network using Proof of Work (PoW).
Computers compete to verify the block the quickest to add it to the chain. The longest chain is considered valid which means so
as long as less than 51% of the computers are bad actors, only valid transactions will be recorded.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>The Introduction</b><p /></div>
Using cash as a medium for trade can be secure, anonymous, trustless, and irreversible, however it only works for in-person or
local transactions. This system worked great for awhile, but globalization took over and now anything can be bought from anywhere
for the lowest price. The solution for internet transactions inolves banks serving as third parties in the verification and maintenance
of the ledger. The ledger is a history of all transactions made using the bank. We can think of all the banks of the world as just one
bank, the third party bank. <p />
<div class="cText"><p />
<b>The Double-Spending Example Without a Third Party</b><i><p/></div>
Abby finds a $10 bill on the ground<p />
Abby calls Matthew and promises to give $10 if Matthew gives her a clue for the Daily Wordle<p />
Matthew agrees and gives Abby a clue and will get the $10 the next time they meet up<p />
Abby still cannot figure out the Wordle so she calls Simon and makes the same deal<p />
Simon agrees to give Abby a clue because he is not aware that Abby already promised the $10 to Matthew<p />
</i>
Even if Matthew and Simon figure out that Abby double-spent her money, it is too late, the boys cannot take back the clues they gave her.
A solution to this problem is to involve a third party, the bank.
<div class="cText"><p />
<b>The Double-Spending Example With a Third Party</b><i></div>
Abby finds a $10 bill on the ground<p />
Abby calls Matthew and offers $10 if Matthew gives her a clue for the Daily Wordle<p />
Matthew agrees and tells Abby to send him the money first<p />
Abby goes to the bank and gives them the $10<p />
The bank then gives Matthew the $10<p />
After Matthew sees the money he gives Abby the clue<p />
Abby still cannot figure out the Wordle so she calls Simon and makes the same deal<p />
Simon agrees and tells Abby to send him the money first<p />
Abby tells the bank to give Simon $10, but since the bank knows Abby already spent it, they refuse the transaction<p />
Simon doesn't receive the money so he doesn't give Abby the clue<p />
</i>
In this sernario, the boys only accept money that has come from the bank. This third party system requires both the buyer and seller
to trust the bank to maintain the ledger. The bank knew that Abby already spent the money because they can look back in their records.
An obvious question arises: What if Matthew accepts the money but doesn't give Abby a clue?<br>
This forces the bank to take on another role, mediator. Abby can dispute the transaction and if she can prove Matthew didn't give her
a clue then the bank can revesre the transaction. Overall the third party must be trusted, know the identies of all parties, and have
the ability to revesre transacitons. The third party gets a lot of trust and personal information from the participates.
