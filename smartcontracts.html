<div class="bTitle"><p><u><strong>Ethereum Smart Contracts</strong></u><p /></div>
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/smartcontracts/thumbnail.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for smart contracts"></img>
Smart contracts are a way of automatically executing transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. This project will
cover the basics of these topics as well as the creation of a smart contract to deploy a Non-Fungible Token (NFT)
on the blockchain. Here is the NFT that will be minted:
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/smartcontracts/img1.PNG" alt="Image to Mint"></img>
<div class="bSub"><p><b>The Basic Basics</b><p /></div>
<b>NFT-</b> A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is some data stored on the blockchain that is unique (the actual code) and
can be traded whilst leaving a permanent and unchangeable record. On the Ethereum blockchain they are also known as
a ERC-721 Token. Unlike an Ether token, these ERC-721 tokens are unique and generally speaking are not traded one
for one. The current trends for NFTs are to be used to store PNG or JPG data to represent digital art work but this
is only one way that the tokens can be used.
<p />
<b>Ether Token-</b> The Ether Token (ERC-20) is the default token used on the Ether Blockchain. It rewarded to miners
for adding blocks to the blockchain and is used to pay transaction fees. These tokens can be exchanged with each other
one for one, unlike NFTs. These tokens do not exist in a physical form and it is not issued by any bank.
<p />
<b>Blockchain-</b> A blockchain is an immutable list of records that are linked cryptographically to each other. The
list is made of blocks which contain data such as the time, transaction details, and link to the previous block.
blockchain is managed by a decentralized network of computers, called nodes. The nodes validate new blocks whilst
following identical protocols. The Ethereum Blockchain differs from the Bitcoin Blockchain because the Eth can contain
smart contracts. This is because the Bitcoin Blockchain is primarily used to store and exchange the Bitcoin cryptocurrency
while the Ethereum Blockchain has more of a general purpose and uses the Ether cryptocurrency as the native token.
Bitcoin was invented first after the 2008 financial crisis and Ether was invented in 2013 after discovering that blockchain
technology can be utilized for much more than just exchanging Bitcoin tokens.
<p />
<b>Smart Contract-</b> These contracts can be thought of as any physical contract such as a mortgage or wager. The difference
between the physical and smart contracts are that the smart contracts are self-executing pertinent to the terms agreed to <body>
all parties. These contracts are stored on the Ether Blockchain and thus are irreversible. The smart contracts can be written
in a language called Solidity and deployed to the blockchain using Ether.
<b>Test Networks-</b>
To interact with the Ethereum Blockchain, gas needs to be spent. Gas is transaction fee which are payments made to the miners
for processing and validating the transaction. As of writing, the gas fee my test smart contract was ~$120 to deploy and mint
an NFT. Gas fees are set by supply and demand and thus can change hour to hour, day to day, etc. The "real" blockchain is
called the mainnet and is where actual transactions occur that cost real money (well, real Ether). Testnets are used to test
smart contracts without the cost of the mainnet. Since the blockchain is immutable, developers need to squash every bug in
their code before deploying it on the mainnet. There are many testnets to work with but currently the one that most resembles
the mainnet is called Ropsten. This testnet uses proof-of-work which is the same as the mainnet, however the Eth on the testnet
is free unlike the mainnet.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Filling a Wallet with Eth</b><p /></div>
Note: This <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/tree/dev/src/content/developers/tutorials/how-to-mint-an-nft">github repo</a>
contains the guide that was referenced through the following sections<p />
Eth is stored in an Ethereum account address. This address can be easily managed via virtual wallet called MetaMask. Once the
MetaMask wallet is set up and connected to the Ropsten testnet, it can be filled with Eth. Crypot faucets in general give out
tiny amounts of crypto for users doing simple tasks. Basically the faucet pays humans to do human-only tasks. However since
we are using a testnet, the Eth is fake and can therefore be given in much larger quantities. Using a faucet my MetaMask account
now has 0.2 Eth (search the current conversion).
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/smartcontracts/img2.png" alt="Wallet Filled with Eth"></img>
Now that the wallet is set up with the Eth we can move onto actually writing the smart contract.
<p />
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Setting the Scene</b><p /></div>
This project will be built using node js and npm. Node.js a runtime environment for network applications. Npm is a package manager for the
node.js platform. The package.json file can be created by using the npm init command. This package contains the metadata of the project
and package/application dependencies. <p />
The other environment that is needed is Hardhat. This is used to test and debug the smart contracts prior to being deployed on the mainnet. The
Hardhat package is executed and a hardhat.config.js is generated which will be used to specify the setup of the smart contract.
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/smartcontracts/img3.png" alt="Hardhat Initialized"></img>
Inside the project there will be two types of code: contracts and scripts. Code such as the smart contract will fall under the contracts type
while deployment and interaction code will fall under the latter.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>The Smart Contract</b><p /></div>
On the Ethereum Blockchain, the smart contracts are written in a language called Solidity which can be viewed as a mix of Python, C++, and
javascript. It contains enough unique features to warrant its own language. Recall that an NFT is a ERC-721 token. Using a library called
OpenZeppelin, the ERC-721 token can be created. Each token has a set of standards that must be followed to be considered a valid token. The
following smart contract is from <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/tree/dev/src/content/developers/tutorials/how-to-mint-an-nft">here</a>
which was based on <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721">this</a> all under the MIT license. The first step is to import
four classes from the openzeppelin library: ERC721.sol, Counters.sol, Ownable.sol, and ERC721URIStorage.sol.<p />
As mentioned previously, a token must meet a certain set of requirements to be considered valid. These requirements are contained in the ERC721 class. The
counter and ownable classes are pretty straightforward, the former counts each NFT minted (for uniqueness) and the latter means only the owner (me) can
use this contract to mint NFTs. The last imported class creates a token with storage basen URI management which means that the metadata for the token is
stored on the blockchain. After the imports there is the following contract:
<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
  contract MyNFT is ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {<br>
      using Counters for Counters.Counter;<br>
      Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;<br>
  <br>
      constructor() ERC721("MyNFT", "NFT") {}<br>
  <br>
      function mintNFT(address recipient, string memory tokenURI)<br>
          public onlyOwner<br>
          returns (uint256)<br>
      {<br>
          _tokenIds.increment();<br>
  <br>
          uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();<br>
          _mint(recipient, newItemId);<br>
          _setTokenURI(newItemId, tokenURI);<br>
  <br>
          return newItemId;<br>
      }}<br>
</p><p />
The first three lines initialize the contract and sets up the counter so the minted NFTs have a unique number (1,2,3,..). The fourth line is a constructor
which is automatically run when the contract is called and calls the imported class with two variables (smart contract name and ticker symbol). Finally
the function mintNFT takes two variables and mints the NFT. The fist variable is the address of my wallet where the NFT will be sent to. Second is the NFTs
metadata, <i>data about the data</i>. This function only allows the owner to call it, creates the tokens ID and returns that ID value.<p />
An .env file is then created with my wallets private key. This .env file is used in the hardhat.config.js file and then the contract is compiled. The NFT
can now be created but it still needs to be deployed to the blockchain to work. This requires another script to put the contract on the blockchain.
<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
  async function main() {<br>
    const MyNFT = await ethers.getContractFactory("MyNFT")<br>
  <br>
    const myNFT = await MyNFT.deploy()<br>
    await myNFT.deployed()<br>
    console.log("Contract deployed to address:", myNFT.address)<br>
  }<br>
  <br>
  main()<br>
    .then(() => process.exit(0))<br>
    .catch((error) => {<br>
      console.error(error)<br>
      process.exit(1)<br>
    })<br>
</p><p />
Again this script is adapted from <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-an-nft/">this</a>. This script uses the
ethers.js and deploys the smart contract to an address. Because the blockchain is public, the contract deployment can be viewed on a Ethereum (Ropsten)
scanner.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Configuring the Data and it's Data</b><p /></div>
The NFT and it's data will be stored on an IPFS (Interplanetary File System) which is a protocol used for storing the data in a decentralized peer-to-peer
network. The metadata for my NFT is pretty simple because it is not a part of a collection or anything like that. NFTs from popular collections will contain
the data of which variations the image has (type of hair, color, accessories, etc). Since the contract is already deployed to the blockchain, we just need
its address to be able to interact with it which again can be found on a blockchain scanner.

mintNFT(<br>
    "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/<br>QmV8GbzM59tsos5QCyVC67YUqGLg7RmCGzbehdnEMZTwhf")<br>
</p><p />
There are many lines of housekeeping at the beginning of the script which includes the NFT and it' metadata as well as the address of the
contract that was deployed. Next the mintNFT function mints the NFT and is signed. Running this will mint our NFT using the smart contract!
Using <a href="https://ropsten.etherscan.io/">Ropsten Etherscan</a>, the transaction can be viewed.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Twitter NFT Profile</b><p /></div>
The NFT has successfully made it to the MetaMask wallet:
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/smartcontracts/img4.jpg" alt="NFT in MetaMask Wallet"></img>
My account started with 0.2 ETH and now has 0.179 ETH which means the transaction cost 0.021 ETH, which is around $100 CAD! Twitter has a paid
subscription plan that allows users to set NFTs as their profile pictures and are notable because the border is a hexagon. I coughed up
the $3.87 for a subscription and connected my accounts to find... my NFT is not there! This is because I minted it on the testnet, not the mainnet.
Bummer.<br>
I barely wanted to spend $4 on the subscription so I am definitely not spending $100 to mint the NFT on the mainnet. I will however do some
photoshopping:
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/smartcontracts/img5.png" alt="Doctored image of NFT Twitter profile picture"></img>
Ta-da, now I have a doctored image showing that I really own the NFT that I made and minted.
