<div class="bTitle"><p><u><strong>CRT IoT</strong></u><p /></div>
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/crtoons/thumbnail.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for smart contracts"></img>
This could be considered a nostalgia machine, a old CRT that has been upgraded with internet capabilities
which enables viewing of cartoons from years past. Specifically the TV show from 1967: Spiderman (in color!)
<div class="bSub"><p><b>The Backstory</b><p /></div>
A quick note: A CRT is an old TV that used cathode ray tubes to project an image through a vacuum. IoT stands
for Internet of Things and basically means giving internet/network capabilities to devices that otherwise
didn't have any.<p />
I was given a Raspberry Pi from my father many years ago and I didn't have a clue what to make with it. I knew
what it was and that there was a whole community around it, but I just couldn't think of anything. It's ironic
that this device basically had endless possibilities yet it sat in my desk drawer for years. Covid hit and
everyone was stuck at home and on video calls. This is when an idea finally manifested in my head; a CRT that
continuously loops old cartoons! There shouldn't be any need to press the power, change the channel, etc. Just
plug and watch. It could be placed in the background as kind of a piece of art. Sadly the project was shelved
when my computer couldn't create an 8hr video file of old looney toons.<p />
Later the RPi was turned into a server so the project was put even deeper into the shelf. Whilst at work I was
learning some bash scripting and it occured to me that I could use bash to loop through many smaller videos
rather than trying to make a single, very long video. Now I needed some more pi. Because of the chip shortage,
the prices of microprocessors were astronomical. They were out of stock from the retailer and heavily marked
up on the second-hand market. I finally found some gen 1 pis in Toronto. The seller happily mailed them to me
and thus the project was afoot.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Procurement</b><p /></div>
The CRT needs a microprocessor and most CRTs only communicate via Component cables. Secondly the pi needs an
external memory device and power. Third the microprocessor needs to be programmed. Each part was not trivial to
obtain.
<p />
<b>CRT-</b> This was actually the last device to obtain because an external monitor could substitute for awhile.
Second-hand marketplaces had a few but they were marked up because the seller thought they were worth even $20.
There was almost a deal for $15 but the seller backed out at the last minute to because apparently his son wanted
it. Eventually a free one was found and picked up near the end of the project (see thumbnail).
<p />
<b>Component Cables-</b> Also a marketplace buy, this time easier and cheap. There was a glaring issue with the cables
however...
<p />
<b>External Memory-</b> The original pi only takes a SD card, not a micro SD, just a SD. Many marketplace sellers seemed
sketchy, as if they bought them in bulk from Ali baba and were upselling them here. Anyway it was a much safer option just
to go to <i>The Source</i>
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Cable Drama</b><p /></div>
HDMI cables are neat. tidy, and consistent. However they are also new-<i>ish</i>. This means that CRTs do not have an HDMI
port, only component ports. An option would be to convert from HDMI to component but but but this would mean buying an
adapter. It is non-trivial to DIY an adapter because HDMI does not send data in the same way a component cable does. This
DIY would involve adding a microcontroller to the mix and coding the conversion. A more simple approach would be to just use
component cables. The RPi has a component video output but no audio out. Instead it has a 3.5mm port (headphone jack). Therefore
the headphone cable needs to be converted to component. These two types of cables both work the same on a basic level so it
can be done.<p />
Both cables are coaxial cables. This means that there is a data cable in the middle with a ground sheath wrapped around it. Thats
it for components but headphones have more than one data cable.

The black bands on the jack are insulators.
