2022 is the first season that I am fully involved in with F1. An exciting part of the season is when the teams
show off their car for the first time. Included is photos (with source) and some comments.

<div class="bSub"><p><b>Mercedes</b><p /></div>
Constructors champions last year Mercedes will defend that title with the new regulations. The Mercees, along
with most other teams are 'porpoising' this year. In videos the violent bouncing is clear and is terriable for
the car. This is because at high speeds the downforce is great enough that the bottom of the car experiences
ground effect. Basically the ground compromises the aerodynamics.

<div class="bSub"><p><b>Red Bull Racing</b><p /></div>
Driver champions last year with some super undercut side pods. These cut side pods look to be a very recent
addition because they are not even painted yet.

<div class="bSub"><p><b>Ferrari</b><p /></div>
Meme king Ferrari, maybe this year is the year... They were top in the first practice and had ground effect
problems to a much lesser extent than Merc.

<div class="bSub"><p><b>McLaren</b><p /></div>
McLaren has been battling for best of the rest over the past couple of years but are looking to maybe shake up
the top 3 this year around. They seem to be in a similar boat as Ferrari.

<div class="bSub"><p><b>Aston Martin</b><p /></div>
Aston Martin really has had a glo-up since the Racing Point Days. Seb was the first driver to say that he would
not race in Russia this year.

<div class="bSub"><p><b>Apline</b><p /></div>
My wife's favourite, because it is pink. Apline use to be a nice blue but BWT took over as a major major sponser
so I gues they get to add their own colours to it.

<div class="bSub"><p><b>AlphaTauri</b><p /></div>
AlphaTauri is like Red Bull 2 but I really like Pierre Gasly so I am always cheering for them.

<div class="bSub"><p><b>Alfa Romeo</b><p /></div>
I <3 the cameo livery. The livery is cameo because the Alfa car wasn't actually launched yet.

<div class="bSub"><p><b>Williams</b><p /></div>
Battle for not last. Oh how Williams use to be so good.

<div class="bSub"><p><b>HAAS</b><p /></div>
HAAS is looking like the back-marker again even though they basically skipped 2021 to develop this car. Fun fact
this photo was taken right before Russia declared war on the Ukraine. HAAS is an american team but has a lot of
connections to Russian sponsers. The biggest HAAS sponser is Uralkali which is owned by Mazepin's father. This
is bad news for Mazepin who has been a 'pay driver' for a year now.
