Jonathan Haidt outlined three theories of how passion and reason work in our minds in the book
<i>The Righteous Mind</i>. I used AI to develop photos of each philosophy by combining the Craiyon tool and
the Style Transfer tool of NightCafe.

All of the following was derived from Jonathan Haidt's book <i>The Righteous Mind</i>. I created a visual
representation of certain parts of his book. This is akin to reading a story in school and then making
a visual representation paired with an explanation.

The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion by Jonathan Haidt is a terrific read
and was recommended to me by my younger brother. In Part 1 of this book, Intuitions Come First, Strategic
Reasoning Come Second, Haidt outlines three possible theories for how passion and reasoning should interact
within our minds. The three theories are from Plato, Thomas Jefferson, and David Hume. Each are explained and
then experiments are done to prove which one is correct.
<p />
Each of the theories involve two characters: Reason and Passion. Reason is the logic behind decisions and
the vocalization of why we do something. Reason is represented by a person. Passion is our intuitions and
moral decisions. Passion is our gut instinct and is represented by an elephant.
 
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Plato: Reason is King</b><p /></div>
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/mind/img3.jpg" alt="Plato's Theory"></img>
Around 400 B.C.E, Plato presented a theory for how passion and reason should interact within our minds.
Plato believed that reason should completely control our passions and we should strive to achieve this balance.
 
 
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Jefferson: Co-Leaders</b><p /></div>
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/mind/img4.jpg" alt="Jefferson's Theory"></img>
Thomas Jefferson (3rd U.S President) challenged Plato's theory by arguing that Reason and Passion where
actually co-leaders of the mind, ruling over separate domains. Each leader made decisions over certain
aspects of our minds but did not consult each other.
 
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Hume: Reason is Slave</b><p /></div>
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/mind/img5.jpg" alt="Hume's Theory"></img>
David Hume proposed a third explanation, reason is a slave to passions. This theory states that our passions,
or gut instincts, come first and reasoning follows. This means that we always retroactively think of
reasoning when we make decisions.
 
<div class="bSub"><p><b>AI Creation</b><p /></div>
To create these images, I used two AI tools: DALL-E mini and Style Transfer. Craiyon hosts the DALL-E mini
tool and it works by receiving a text prompt and outputting four images. I started with Craiyon and
entered prompts until I got images of what I was looking for.

Like any tool, it takes some time to learn what is needed as inputs and how the tool processes prompts.
Secondly I took the images and used the Style Transfer tool on NightCafe to make them look painted.

Both tools are somewhat free and can be accessed online.
 
 
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Which is Correct?</b><p /></div>
For this, I recommend reading the book, or at least the first part. Haidt gives examples and does
experiments to determine how reasoning and passion interact with each other.
