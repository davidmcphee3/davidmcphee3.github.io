<div class="bTitle"><p><u><strong>Website From Scratch</strong></u><p /></div>
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/website/thumbnail.png" alt="Thumbnail for website"></img>
A website is actually a directory and the files within it make up the website. It was made from scratch so
no online website builders like Wix or SquareSpace. It is the first time that I ever used HTML or CSS so I have
noted many basic examples and small victories.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Welcome To My Domain</b><p /></div>
Here is a break down the domain: <i>http://www.davidmcphee.ca</i>, it is best to start at the end and work our
way backward. <p /><i>.ca</i> is a top-level domain for Canada. The Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA)
operates the domain name registry. Basically Canadians, like me, can register their domain with the CIRA to give a
human-readable name to their server (website). The CIRA only registers domains through a certified registrar like
GoDaddy. Other examples of top-level domains are <i>.com, .org, .notascam</i> to name a few have different rules
and hoops to jump through. <p /><i>.davidmcphee</i> is a domain and is pointed to the server hosting these web
files. It is a domain of .ca in the example. <p /><i>www</i> is a sub-domain of .davidmcphee. Thats right, www is
an optional sub-domain of my website rather than the other way around. The reason for this is that computers were
invented before the internet and had different functions. These functions required different types of information
from the computer and thus programmers added sub-domains for each function. When the World Wide Web came along
they simply added another sub-domain for that purpose. The internet has become so popular that developers just
dropped the www. sub-domain and made it the default domain for their server.
<p /><i>http://</i> is the protocol used to connect the computers together. In this case it is HyperText Transfer
Protocol, this means that the users computer is requesting HTML files from the host computer. ie the user is
attempting to view a webpage.
<p /><i>http://www.davidmcphee.ca</i> really means that a user is requesting HTML files from the server that
davidmcphee.ca is pointing at.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Server Structure</b><p /></div>
When a user requests an HTML file, they are sent the file at the default location in the Raspberry Pi
/var/www/html/. In the html/ directory is a file named index.html which is sent to the user. There are other
html files in this directory that a user can access if they type in the path or click on the nav bar. Each
page has its own HTML. There are also .png, .jpg, and .pdf files on the RPi server if you look hard enough. The
webmaster can restrict access to certain directories if they so choose.<p />
There is another very important file on the web server, main.css. A CSS file adds all of the beauty to a website.
HTML is the foundation and frames, CSS is the drywall and paint. Another typical file that can be found on a
server is a javascript file. This is the light switches, buttons, and appliances of the house. Each of these
files, HTML, CSS, javascript, have different syntax and structure and it is up to the webmaster to make them work
together. <p />
With all of this together it is clear why most people use a website builder, but not this website. This project
gave me the opportunity to learn HTML and CSS with real world applications. It was a try-and-fail approach most
of the time but sometimes it just worked.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>HTML</b><p /></div>
The HTML is not too complex for this server. It includes a header where the CSS is linked, and a body. HTML is
a bunch of blocks placed on top of one another. It is in the CSS where the blocks get placed and shaped. The two
tricky parts of this HTML is the embedded tweet and the comment box below. Each of these are iframes and are
placed directly into the HTML code. A block is placed around the twitter iframe so it can be moved and sized. The
comment box on the other hand did not work with that approach so it is all by itself in another main block. Any
websites HTML can be viewed by right-clicking and selecting "view page source". Here is a photo of the first
custom HTML for this server:
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/website/img1.png" alt="First custom HTML"></img>
<div class="bSub"><p><b>CSS</b><p /></div>
The previous image was OK, but why is the background white? Why is the text small and Times New Roman? Why is
there no nav bar? These questions can be answered with CSS.
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/website/img2.png" alt="Webpage with CSS"></img>
The webpage is now grey with a light-grey box to hold all of the text and nav bar. The text and nav bar are
defined in the HTML but it is the CSS that places them. The 'photo of me' is missing because it was not on the
RPi server. There is a command <i>scp</i> that was used to transfer images and files from the workstation to the
webserver. It was found that the quickest way to check changes on the CSS and HTML was to connect to the local IP
rather than the domain. This is because the local IP is on LAN where as the domain has to travel to many servers.
Chrome would cache the CSS making it appear as though none of the changes had been made so the cache had to be
cleared every reload.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Now What?</b><p /></div>
The HTML and CSS are clearly more advanced now than in the previous image but there are still so many tips and
tricks that can and will be implemented. There are currently no javascript files on this server which is sad.
Hopefully that will change in the future. Remember the HTML and CSS can be inspected, take a look and let me
know if you find anything odd.
