There are many ways that a service can store credentials for their users. This project
demonstrates 3 different storage solutions with a python example. A coworker was telling me 
about his cybersecurity class and how passwords are stored. I found that python could hash strings
so I built my own authentication manager.

  One of the simplest ways for a service to store a user's credentials is to create a table in a database (or in this case,
  a file) with all user's username and password.
