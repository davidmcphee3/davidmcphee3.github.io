<div class="bTitle"><p><u><strong>Ethereum Smart Contracts</strong></u><p /></div>
<img class="bImg" src="/includes/projects/smartcontracts/thumbnail.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for smart contracts"></img>
Smart contracts are a way of automatically executing transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. This project will
cover the basics of these topics as well as the creation of a smart contract to deploy a Non-Fungible Token (NFT)
on the blockchain. Here is the NFT that will be minted:

<div class="bSub"><p><b>The Basic Basics</b><p /></div>
<b>NFT-</b> A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is some data stored on the blockchain that is unique (the actual code) and
can be traded whilst leaving a permanent and unchangable record. On the Ethereum blockchain they are also known as
a ERC-721 Token. Unlike an Ether token, these ERC-721 tokens are unique and generally speaking are not traded one
for one. The current trends for NFTs are to be used to store PNG or JPG data to represent digital art work but this
is only one way that the tokens can be used.
<p />
<b>Ether Token-</b> The Ether Token (ERC-20) is the default token used on the Ether Blockchain. It rewarded to miners
for adding blocks to the blockchain and is used to pay transaction fees. These tokens can be exchanged with eachother
one for one, unlike NFTs. These tokens do not exist in a physical form and it is not issued by any bank.
<p />
<b>Blockchain-</b> A blockchain is an imutable list of records that are linked cryptographically to each other. The
list is made of blocks which contain data such as the time, transaction details, and link to the previous block. <thead>
blockchain is managed by a decentralized network of computers, called nodes. The nodes validate new blocks whilst
following identical protocols. The Ethereum Blockchain differs from the Bitcoin Blockchain because the Eth can contain
smart contracts. This is because the Bitcoin Blockchain is primarily used to store and exchange the Bitcoin cryptocurrency
while the Ethereum Blockchain has more of a general purpose and uses the Ether cryptocurrency as the native token.
Bitcoin was invented first after the 2008 financial crisis and Ether was invented in 2013 after discovering that blockchain
technology can be utilized for much more than just exchanging Bitcoin tokens.
<p />
<b>Smart Contract-</b> These contracts can be thought of as any physical contract such as a mortgage or wager. The differnce
between the physical and smart contracts are that the smart contracts are self-executing pertinent to the terms agreed to <body>
all parties. These contracts are stored on the Ether Blockchain and thus are irreversible. The smart contracts can be written
in a language called Solidity and deployed to the blockchain using Ether.
<b>Test Networks-</b>
To interact with the Ethereum Blockchain, gas needs to be spent. Gas is transaction fee which are payments made to the miners
for processing and validating the transaction. As of writing, the gas fee my test smart contract was ~$120 to deploy and mint
an NFT. Gas fees are set by supply and demand and thus can change hour to hour, day to day, etc. The "real" blockchain is
called the mainnet and is where actaul transactions occur that cost real money (well, real Ether). Testnets are used to test
smart contracts without the cost of the mainnet. Since the blockchain is immutable, developers need to squash every bug in
their code before deploying it on the mainnet. There are many testnets to work with but currently the one that most resembles
the mainnet is called Ropsten. This testnet uses proof-of-work which is the same as the mainnet, however the Eth on the testnet
is free unlike the mainnet.
<div class="bSub"><p><b>Filling a Wallet with Eth</b><p /></div>
Note: This <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/tree/dev/src/content/developers/tutorials/how-to-mint-an-nft">github repo</a>
contains the guide that was referenced through the following sections<p />
Eth is stored in an Ethereum account address. This address can be easily managed via virtual wallet called MetaMask. Once the
MetaMask wallet is set up and connected to the Ropsten testnet, it can be filled with Eth. Crypot faucets in general give out
tiny amounts of crypto for users doing simple tasks. Basically the faucet pays humans to do human-only tasks. However since
we are using a testnet, the Eth is fake and can therefore be given in much larger quantities. Using a facuet my MetaMask account
now has 0.2 Eth (search the current conversion).

Now that the wallet is set up with the Eth we can move onto actually writing the smart contract.
